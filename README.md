# Neural-Network-Visualizer
### A basic Neural network visualizer web app
---
## Neural network visualizer web app  to see how a neural network works on different layers using streamlit and flask

Building a Neural network to make predictions on the MNIST dataset and then deploying the model using Flask and streamlit

ADDTIONAL PRE-REQUISITES
1. streamlit
2. flask

- Clone the repository
- if you want to train the model again 
   - delete the exisiting trained model "model.h5"
   - re-run all the cells of the "Main Notebook" to train the model again and save it
   - run the server and the streamplot app.py accordingly
- else , just deploy the model using
  - python ml_server.py
  - streamlit run app.py
